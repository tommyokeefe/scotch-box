# Database Dumps

if you put your database dumps here and make sure the name of the database matches the name of the sql file (ie, `mysite` & `mysite.sql`) they will be imported everytime you run `vagrant up` or `vagrant provision` and re-exported every time you run `vagrant halt` or `vagrant destroy`
